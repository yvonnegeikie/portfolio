# Portfolio page
 - The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills and ability gained in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, MongoDB and SQL over the 16 week Software and Web Dev Bootcamp I finished in March 2024
 - There are 4 projects available to view and links to my contact card, CV, GitHub and LinkedIn
 - I created this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. I chose this theme because it is clean, simple and professional.
