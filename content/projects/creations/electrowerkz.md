I worked with a digital designer to help build and customize a
Squarespace website with a custom theme. The challenge here was to build a
flexible layout whilst making the content accessible and intuitive to edit for a
non-technical client.

I used a combination of the built-in page builder and custom CSS to achieve
the required design and effects.

This was my first time working with a page builder, and I found it challenging
working in an environment where I was limited by how much editing I could make
to the HTML, so I had to get creative with the CSS.
