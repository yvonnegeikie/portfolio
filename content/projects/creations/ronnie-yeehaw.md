Ronnie Yehaw is an Australian-raised, Montreal-based singer-songwriter who is also my sister. Ronnie plays in a band and produces her own music, performing at small and intimate gigs across Canada. I decided to create a demo site for her for my first ever project required in the bootcamp I was attending at the time. This is a custom-designed and hand-coded website where I can demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. At the time of its creation, Ronnie was recording an album, so was protective of the original material, but she graciously let me use some demo media for the purpose of this project.
