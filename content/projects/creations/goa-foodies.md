Goa Foodies was created on the fly while experimenting with Bootstrap. I had recently been in Goa and decided to highlight my top three favourite dishes. I used AI to generate the blog post and the recipes (try at your own peril) as the purpose of this mini-project was to play around with the Bootstrap functions, tweaked with some HTML and CSS. I had a lot of fun with this and would like to explore more frameworks to work with.
